![APTUI Preview](https://res.cloudinary.com/techstructive-blog/image/upload/v1655915241/blog-media/aptui/aptui-temp-logo.png)

An terminal interface for testing and working with APIs and web requests. It is(will be) like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) applications but in the terminal. Though it won't be a fully feldged application like those GUIs but it would serve the basic functionalities for testing APIs. 

API + TUI = APTUI
